### Overview

The HSE Kafka driver is a fundamental piece of the vacuum Data Pipeline project, as this driver is responsible for actually streaming the required vacuum datapoints into Kafka. It will be integrated into a WinCC-OA project as a new manager.

We will also start a WinCC-OA control manager that will read the exporter configuration file (generated by VacCC Exporter) and send data to Kafka thanks to the HSE driver.

This section explains:

- How to compile the Kafka driver binary: steps to follow for getting the driver binary file and the compiled external dependencies.

- How to run the Kafka Driver on WinCC-OA: steps to follow for starting the WCCOAkafkaDrv manager.

- Security configurations for accessing CERN Kafka Cluster: steps to follow for configuring the access to the Kafka cluster (through Kerberos and SSL authentication).

- How to run a Kafka consumer: steps to follow for downloading Kafka binaries, configuring and executing a Kafka consumer.

- Validation: shows a demo on how we can configure and send a message from WinCC-OA to Kafka. For checking it, we will see if the message was received by the Kafka consumer.
