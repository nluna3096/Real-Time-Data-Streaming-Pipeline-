# My Projects

Welcome to my personal repository.

Next, I will briefly introduce the contents of each project in the repository.


# Contents

This repository has been divided into three folders, each one containing information about different projects.

The first folder (1- Real Time Data Streaming Pipeline), shows the work developed during my stay at CERN.
The second folder (2- Machine Learning with Python), shows two different applications of Python in Machine Learning and optimization problems respectively.
The third folder (3- R codes), shows two examples of statistics and predictive modeling techniques applied to some specific data sets.
